            Organic farming, also known as ecological farming or biological
            farming, is an agricultural system that uses fertilizers of organic
            origin. Growing and eating organic food supports human and
            environmental health while fostering thriving local economies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Organic agriculture does not permit the use of synthetic chemical
            pesticides or herbicides. Most of the pesticides that are allowed in
            organic are derived from natural products, are low in toxicity and
            break down rapidly.

            <p>
              The garden strawberry are cultivated worldwide for their fruit.
              The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma,
              bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in
              large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam,
              juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates.
            </p>
            <p>
              To maintain top quality, berries are harvested at least every
              other day. The berries are picked with the caps still attached and
              with at least half an inch of stem left. Strawberries need to
              remain on the plant to fully ripen because they do not continue to
              ripen after being picked. Rotted and overripe berries are removed
              to minimize insect and disease problems. The berries do not get
              washed until just before consumption.

            <p>
              This popular small fruit bears plenty of berries that are
              delightful when eaten fresh, used in pies, muffins, or pancakes,
              or added as a fruit topping for breakfast cereals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Blueberry fruit ripens over a two-month period after bloom. This
              will vary with the cultivar, weather conditions and plant vigor.

            <p>
              The fruit is harvested when it comes off the receptacle easily and
              has turned a deep color (red, black, purple, or golden yellow,
              depending on the species and cultivar). This is when the fruits
              are ripest and sweetest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Raspberries are grown for the fresh fruit market into individually
              quick frozen fruit, pur√©e, juice, or as dried fruit used in a
              variety of grocery products such as raspberry pie. Raspberries
              need ample sun and water for optimal development.
